## Traffic Light Safety System

Our **traffic light system** guides you toward a safer Roblox experience:

Usage
1. Safe – Content or users that are safe to interact with.
2. Suspicious – Users who may be behaving suspiciously and will be monitored more closely.
3. Unsafe – Content or users deemed unsafe and you should stay clear.

This helps you make better decisions while navigating Roblox.

[Blur content feature] (COMING SOON) automatically hides inappropriate material, and anything reported as unsafe will be handled automatically so you don’t have to worry about it!
